# Data-and-Code-for-STAR-Protocols
Utah-style microelectrode array (UMA) recording obtained from a neurosurgical patient with medically refractory epilepsy as they underwent propofol-induced loss of consciousness. We present the code to detect and characterize the spatiotemporal dynamics of traveling waves from non-oscillatory neural activity.
